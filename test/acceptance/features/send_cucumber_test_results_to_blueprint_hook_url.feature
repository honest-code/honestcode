Feature: Send cucumber test results to blueprint hook url
  As a Client
  I want to be able to send a test result to honestcode.io

  Scenario: POST /api/hook/tr/ with no errors
    Given I already have the file "test_results.json" with result "{}"
    And I already have the blueprint hook code "HOOK_VALID_CODE"
    When I request to send the test results
    Then I don't receive any error
